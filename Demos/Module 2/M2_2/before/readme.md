Writing your first node.js application.

First check that you have node installed!

Using the command line

1. Create a new folder (mkdir vehicles)
2. Open the folder (cd vehicles)
3. Initialise the node project (npm init) or to use defauts (npm init -y)
4. Create your first file (touch vehicles.js)

You can also perform these steps directly within VSCode or your editor of choice.
