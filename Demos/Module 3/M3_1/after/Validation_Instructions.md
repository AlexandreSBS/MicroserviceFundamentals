# Validation Instructions

If you have successfully installed all of the components then you should be able to check everything using the following steps.

1. Open a command line terminal in Visual Studio Code.
2. Install version 20.2.2 of Node.js using NVM:

    ```shell
    nvm install 20.6.1
3. Once the installation is complete you can set this as the default version of Node by running this command:

    ```shell
    nvm alias default 20.6.1

4. You can then confirm your Node version by using the following command:

    ```shell
    node -v

This command should return 20.6.1 in the terminal.
